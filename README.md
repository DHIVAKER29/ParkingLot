Design a parking lot system that allows cars to be parked, unparked, and tracks the availability of parking spaces. The parking lot should have different types of parking spots to accommodate different sizes of cars. The system should ensure that cars are parked in the appropriate spots based on their size.

Key Features:
Car Types:

There are different types of cars based on their size:
Small cars
Medium cars
Large cars
Parking Spot Types:

The parking lot has a limited number of parking spots, categorized as:
Small spots: Can accommodate small cars only.
Medium spots: Can accommodate small or medium cars.
Large spots: Can accommodate small, medium, or large cars.
Operations:

Park a car: The system should find an available parking spot based on the size of the car and allocate it.
Unpark a car: The system should free up a spot when a car leaves the parking lot.
Track available spots: The system should be able to provide the current availability of parking spots by type (small, medium, large).
Constraints:

The parking lot has a fixed number of each type of spot.
Cars can only be parked in spots that can accommodate their size (e.g., a large car cannot park in a small or medium spot).
